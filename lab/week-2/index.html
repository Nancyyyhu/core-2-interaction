FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Who's there?
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Long live the king!
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Bernardo?
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
He.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
You come most carefully upon your hour.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Have you had quiet guard?
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Not a mouse stirring.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
<br>
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
Friends to this ground.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
And liegemen to the Dane.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Give you good night.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
<br>
Exit
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
Holla! Bernardo!
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
A piece of him.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
<br>
<B>BERNARDO</B>
I have seen nothing.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
