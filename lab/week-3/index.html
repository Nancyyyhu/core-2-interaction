FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Hamlet"><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
Who's there?
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Hamlet"><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Long live the king!
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Bernardo?
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
He.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
You come most carefully upon your hour.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Have you had quiet guard?
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Not a mouse stirring.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
<br>
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_(Hamlet)"><b>HORATIO</b></a>
Friends to this ground.
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Hamlet"><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
And liegemen to the Dane.
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Give you good night.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
<br>
<b>FRANCISCO</b>
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
<br>
Exit
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
Holla! Bernardo!
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
A piece of him.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
<br>
<B>BERNARDO</B>
I have seen nothing.
<br>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
<br>
<b>HORATIO</b>
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
<br>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, 
<br>HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, 
<br>CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Claudius"><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
<br>
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
<br>
<br>
<b>CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND</b>
<br>
In that and all things will we show our duty.
<br>
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
<br>
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laertes_(Hamlet)#:~:text=Laertes%20is%20the%20son%20of,poison%2C%20he%20implicates%20King%20Claudius."><b>LAERTES</b></a>
<br>
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
<br>
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
<br>
<br>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<br>
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
<br>
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
<br>
<br>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<br>
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
<br>
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
<br>
<br>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<br>
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
<br>
<br>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<br>
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
<br>
<br>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<br>
Ay, madam, it is common.
<br>
<br>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<br>
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
<br>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<br>
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
<br>
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
<br>
<br>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<br>
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
<br>
<br>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<br>
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
<br>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<br>
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
<br>
Exeunt all but HAMLET
